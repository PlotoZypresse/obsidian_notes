  
1. **Board Representation**:
    
    - Decide on a data structure to represent the chessboard. This could be a 2D array, a matrix, or a custom class representing each square.
    - Initialize the board with the starting position of the pieces.
2. **Piece Representation**:
    
    - Create a class or struct to represent each chess piece. Each piece should have attributes like its type (pawn, rook, knight, etc.), color (white or black), and position on the board.
    - Implement methods to move the pieces on the board and check for valid moves according to the rules of chess.
3. **Game Logic**:
    
    - Implement the main game loop.
    - Allow players to input their moves (e.g., using algebraic notation like "e2e4").
    - Check the validity of moves and update the board accordingly.
    - Implement the rules for capturing pieces, castling, en passant, pawn promotion, and checkmate.
4. **User Interface**:
    
    - Create a simple text-based interface to display the chessboard and allow players to make moves.
    - Display the current state of the game, including whose turn it is and any messages about the game (e.g., "Check!" or "Checkmate!").
    - Optionally, you can later enhance this to a graphical user interface using a library like SFML or SDL.
5. **Game Flow**:
    
    - Implement the game flow logic, such as checking for check and checkmate, handling stalemates, and determining the end of the game.
    - Allow players to start a new game or quit.
6. **Testing**:
    
    - Write test cases to ensure that the game behaves correctly under various scenarios.
    - Test edge cases and unusual situations to verify that the game logic is robust.
7. **Documentation and Comments**:
    
    - Document your code, including function descriptions, class descriptions, and any complex algorithms or data structures.
    - Add comments throughout your code to explain your thought process and make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand.
8. **Refactoring and Optimization**:
    
    - Once your game is working, consider refactoring your code to improve readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
    - Optimize any performance bottlenecks, especially if you plan to scale your game or add more features later.
9. **Additional Features (Optional)**:
    
    - Implement features like undo/redo functionality, saving and loading games, AI opponents, or multiplayer support
