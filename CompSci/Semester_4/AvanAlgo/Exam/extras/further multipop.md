### MULTIPOP Operation:
- **Operation**: MULTIPOP(S, k)
- **Effect**: Removes `k'` elements from the stack, where `k' = min{s, k}`. This means it will remove the smaller number between `s` (current stack size) and `k` (the number of elements you want to remove).

### Amortized Cost Analysis:
Amortized cost analysis helps us understand the average performance of an operation over a sequence of operations, smoothing out the expensive ones by averaging them over all operations.

#### Actual Cost (`c_i`):
- For the MULTIPOP operation, the actual cost `c_i` is `k'`, because `k'` elements are being removed.

#### Potential Difference (`Φ`):
- `Φ(D_i)`: Potential function after the `i-th` operation.
- `Φ(D_{i-1})`: Potential function before the `i-th` operation.

The potential difference is calculated as:
\[ Φ(D_i) - Φ(D_{i-1}) = -k' \]
This means the potential function decreases by `k'` because we're removing `k'` elements from the stack.

#### Amortized Cost (`Ĉ_i`):
The amortized cost is given by:
\[ Ĉ_i = c_i + Φ(D_i) - Φ(D_{i-1}) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ Ĉ_i = k' + (-k') = 0 \]

So, the amortized cost of the MULTIPOP operation is 0. 

### Interpretation:
Even though the actual cost of popping multiple elements (`k'`) might seem high, the amortized analysis shows that, on average, the cost is zero when considering the sequence of operations. This is because the potential function decrease (`-k'`) balances out the actual cost (`k'`), resulting in an overall amortized cost of zero.

In essence, while MULTIPOP may be costly in terms of actual operations, the amortized cost indicates that this operation is effectively "free" when considering the overall series of operations on the stack.
