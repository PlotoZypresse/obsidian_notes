100 000
80 000 democratic and 20 000 republican
$$
1/100 * 80000 = 800
$$
So 800 of the people who would vote for the democrats would vote for the rpublican
$$
1/100*20000=200
$$
So 200 of the people who would vote for the republicans would vote for the democrat
This would give us
$$
(80000+200)-800=79400
$$
