- when is it relevvant for the scheduler to take a decison
	- When ther is open processing power
	- When process is switching between states or terminates
- What scheduling criteria can we use?
	- When the job comes in
	- Job length
	- expected next time
	- CPU utilization
	- turnaround time
- Describe the schedling algorithms: FCFS, SJf, Shortest remaining time first, RR
	- First in first out as name implies
	- Shortes job first
- Describe Priority scheduling and aging
	- Priority schedluing is when the jobs have a priority and we pick the highest prob first
	- aging is when over time a job that has a low priority has to wait a long time it gets a priority invcrease.
- What is the difference between Aymetric and Symetric multiprocessing
	- asymetric is where one processor acceses the systems data structures, no need for datasharing
	- SMP each processor is self scheduling all process in common ready queue
- What is a memory stall
	- when the cpu only runs io processes and no cpu heavy processes
- Describe Rate monotonic schedluing and earliest deadline first scheduling
