- In which stages can adress binding happen?
	- at compile time, at program startup time,
- what is a relocation register
- Describe dynamic loading and dynamic linking
	- linking at execution time
- descirbe swapping and the backing stores role 
	- swapping is when memory pages are stored on disc to free up memory
	- 
- describe some algorithms for the dynamic storage-allocation problelm
	- first fit, best fit, worst fit
- differnce between external and internal fragmentation?
	- When memory pages are allocated to a process the process can not fill out the page completly(internal fragmentation) or the space between pages can be so small that no other process can use it(externak fragmentaion)
- describe paging
	-  instead off accesing every bit of memory the memory is made up of pages that get allocated to processes
