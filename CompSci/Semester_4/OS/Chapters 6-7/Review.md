- Describe the terms "race condition" and "Critical section"
	-  A race condition is when if two processes acces/maniplute at the same time the same data concucrently and thus give the wrong result
	- Critival section is a part of code where race conditions could happen so u make it critical
- What should a good solution to the critical section problem satisfy
	- Mutual exclusion
	- progrwss
	- bounded waiting
- Describe "test and set" and "compare and swap"
	- hardware backed options for implemnting atomic operatins
	- 
- Wha tis a mutex and a semaphore
	- mutex is a simple lock often implemented with busy waiting
	- semaphore: alockw ith wait and signal operaations no busy waiting usually has a number of resources
- describe some classic problems of synchronization
	- dining philosophers porblem
- What is a monitor
