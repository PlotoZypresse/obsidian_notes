- it returns 5 as the initial value is 5, we only add 15 in the child process.

- Foreground and background processes
- splitscreen
- race conditions
- scheduling
- interproces communication

- if it is in the register we simply move the pointer to the new registers
- the registers data is copied to memory so it can be loaded at a later point

- the heap and stack are not shared as the heap is dynamically allocated during run time and the stack is temporary data from functions
- shared memory is shared between child and parent

- PErforme a state safe and then we flush the registers and load in the new information
