To address the question in the provided image, we need to determine how many different combinations of the given items can exist in a transaction. The items listed are:

- apples
- bananas
- cherries
- dates
- eggplants
- figs
- guavas

Since we do not distinguish between the number of times an item is bought (i.e., having "apples" in a transaction means at least one apple is bought), each item can either be included in a transaction or not. This is essentially a problem of counting the number of subsets of a set with 7 items.

### Calculation

Each item has 2 possibilities: it can either be included in the transaction or not included. Therefore, for \( n \) items, the total number of combinations (subsets) is given by \( 2^n \).

Here, \( n = 7 \), so the total number of different transactions is:

\[ 2^7 = 128 \]

This includes the empty transaction (no items purchased).

### General Growth with Increasing Number of Items

For a general case with \( n \) items, the number of different transactions is \( 2^n \). This means that as the number of items increases, the number of possible transactions grows exponentially.

To summarize:
1. The number of different transactions for the given 7 items is \( 128 \).
2. The number of possible transactions grows exponentially as \( 2^n \), where \( n \) is the number of items.

To determine the number of transactions with exactly two items (2-itemsets) and how this generalizes to \( k \)-itemsets, we can use combinations from combinatorics.

### Transactions with Exactly Two Items (2-itemsets)

The number of ways to choose 2 items out of a total of \( n \) items is given by the binomial coefficient:

\[ $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}$ \]

This represents the number of 2-itemsets that can be formed from \( n \) items.

1. **When the database contains 3 items:**
\[ $\binom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \frac{3 \times 2 \times 1}{2 \times 1 \times 1} = 3$ \]

2. **When the database contains 5 items:**
\[ $\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10$ \]

### Generalization to \( k \)-itemsets

The number of ways to choose \( k \) items out of \( n \) items is given by:

\[ $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ \]

So, the number of \( k \)-itemsets in a database containing \( n \) items is \( \binom{n}{k} \).

### Summary

- **Number of 2-itemsets when the database contains 3 items:** 3
- **Number of 2-itemsets when the database contains 5 items:** 10
- **Number of \( k \)-itemsets when the database contains \( n \) items:** \( \binom{n}{k} \)

To address the questions based on the given set of transactions, we need to analyze the support and confidence of certain itemsets and rules, as well as determine some characteristics of the dataset.

Given the set of transactions \( T \):

| Transaction ID | Items in basket                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1              | {Milk, Beer, Diapers}             |
| 2              | {Bread, Butter, Milk}             |
| 3              | {Milk, Diapers, Cookies}          |
| 4              | {Bread, Butter, Cookies}          |
| 5              | {Beer, Cookies, Diapers}          |
| 6              | {Milk, Diapers, Bread, Butter}    |
| 7              | {Bread, Butter, Diapers}          |
| 8              | {Beer, Diapers}                   |
| 9              | {Milk, Diapers, Bread, Butter}    |
| 10             | {Beer, Cookies}                   |

### (a) Support and confidence of {Milk} ⇒ {Diapers}

**Support** of {Milk} ⇒ {Diapers}:
- Support is the proportion of transactions that contain both {Milk} and {Diapers}.
- Transactions with both {Milk} and {Diapers}: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Number of such transactions: 4
- Total number of transactions: 10

\[ \text{Support} = \frac{4}{10} = 0.4 \]

**Confidence** of {Milk} ⇒ {Diapers}:
- Confidence is the proportion of transactions containing {Milk} that also contain {Diapers}.
- Transactions with {Milk}: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Number of such transactions: 5

\[ \text{Confidence} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \]

### (b) Support and confidence of {Diapers} ⇒ {Milk}

**Support** of {Diapers} ⇒ {Milk}:
- This is the same as the support of {Milk} ⇒ {Diapers}, as support is symmetric.

\[ \text{Support} = 0.4 \]

**Confidence** of {Diapers} ⇒ {Milk}:
- Confidence is the proportion of transactions containing {Diapers} that also contain {Milk}.
- Transactions with {Diapers}: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Number of such transactions: 7

\[ \text{Confidence} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

### (c) Maximum number of association rules

The maximum number of association rules can be calculated based on the possible non-empty subsets of the itemsets. For a set with \( n \) items, the number of possible non-empty subsets is \( 2^n - 1 \).

For each subset, we can form rules by splitting into antecedent and consequent, giving us:

\[ 3^n - 2^{n+1} + 1 \]

However, since not all these rules are valid if they do not appear in transactions, it's better to work directly with the transaction list and count valid itemsets and possible rules. Let's just calculate for each possible combination directly if needed.

### (d) Maximum size of frequent itemsets (assuming support \( \sigma > 0 \))

Since any itemset with support greater than 0 can be considered frequent, we need the largest itemset found in the transactions.

- The largest itemset in the transactions is {Milk, Diapers, Bread, Butter} (4 items).

So, the maximum size of frequent itemsets is 4.

### (e) Itemset of size 2 or larger with the largest support

Let's calculate the support for all 2-itemsets:

- {Milk, Diapers}: 4 transactions (1, 3, 6, 9)
- {Milk, Bread}: 3 transactions (2, 6, 9)
- {Milk, Butter}: 3 transactions (2, 6, 9)
- {Milk, Beer}: 1 transaction (1)
- {Milk, Cookies}: 1 transaction (3)
- {Beer, Diapers}: 3 transactions (1, 5, 8)
- {Beer, Cookies}: 3 transactions (5, 8, 10)
- {Diapers, Cookies}: 2 transactions (3, 5)
- {Diapers, Bread}: 3 transactions (6, 7, 9)
- {Diapers, Butter}: 2 transactions (6, 9)
- {Bread, Butter}: 4 transactions (2, 4, 6, 9)
- {Bread, Cookies}: 2 transactions (4, 6)
- {Butter, Cookies}: 2 transactions (4, 6)

The highest support for itemsets of size 2 is 4 for {Bread, Butter} and {Milk, Diapers}.

### (f) Pair of items such that the rules {a} ⇒ {b} and {b} ⇒ {a} have the same confidence

For {Bread} ⇒ {Butter} and {Butter} ⇒ {Bread}, let's calculate:

- Support for both {Bread, Butter}: 4
- Confidence of {Bread} ⇒ {Butter}: 4 / 4 = 1
- Confidence of {Butter} ⇒ {Bread}: 4 / 4 = 1

So, the pair (Bread, Butter) has the same confidence for both rules.

### Exercise 7-3 Apriori Candidate Generation

Given the complete collection of frequent 3-itemsets in a transaction database:

\[
\{1, 2, 3\}, \{1, 2, 4\}, \{1, 2, 5\}, \{1, 3, 4\}, \{1, 3, 5\}, \{2, 3, 4\}, \{2, 3, 5\}, \{3, 4, 5\}
\]

### (a) List all candidate 4-itemsets following the Apriori joining and pruning procedure.

To generate candidate 4-itemsets, we apply the Apriori principle, which involves two steps: joining and pruning.

1. **Joining Step**: Combine frequent 3-itemsets that share two common items to form candidate 4-itemsets.

- \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(\{1, 2, 4\}\) form \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
- \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(\{1, 2, 5\}\) form \(\{1, 2, 3, 5\}\)
- \(\{1, 2, 4\}\) and \(\{1, 2, 5\}\) form \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\)
- \(\{1, 3, 4\}\) and \(\{1, 3, 5\}\) form \(\{1, 3, 4, 5\}\)
- \(\{2, 3, 4\}\) and \(\{2, 3, 5\}\) form \(\{2, 3, 4, 5\}\)

2. **Pruning Step**: Check if all subsets of the candidate 4-itemsets are frequent 3-itemsets.

Candidate 4-itemsets:

- \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\): All subsets \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), \(\{1, 2, 4\}\), \(\{1, 3, 4\}\), and \(\{2, 3, 4\}\) are frequent.
- \(\{1, 2, 3, 5\}\): All subsets \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), \(\{1, 2, 5\}\), \(\{1, 3, 5\}\), and \(\{2, 3, 5\}\) are frequent.
- \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\): Subsets \(\{1, 2, 4\}\), \(\{1, 2, 5\}\), and \(\{2, 4, 5\}\). \(\{2, 4, 5\}\) is not in the list, so \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\) is pruned.
- \(\{1, 3, 4, 5\}\): All subsets \(\{1, 3, 4\}\), \(\{1, 3, 5\}\), \(\{1, 4, 5\}\), and \(\{3, 4, 5\}\). \(\{1, 4, 5\}\) is not in the list, so \(\{1, 3, 4, 5\}\) is pruned.
- \(\{2, 3, 4, 5\}\): All subsets \(\{2, 3, 4\}\), \(\{2, 3, 5\}\), \(\{2, 4, 5\}\), and \(\{3, 4, 5\}\). \(\{2, 4, 5\}\) is not in the list, so \(\{2, 3, 4, 5\}\) is pruned.

After pruning, the remaining candidate 4-itemsets are:

- \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
- \(\{1, 2, 3, 5\}\)

### (b) Discuss the case \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\) – why it cannot be frequent, and which should be the first one to find and stop searching.

**Reasons \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\) cannot be frequent:**

1. If any of its 3-item subsets are not frequent, then \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\) cannot be frequent. In this case, \(\{2, 4, 5\}\) is not a frequent 3-itemset.
2. If any transaction containing \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\) does not exist in the dataset, it cannot be frequent.

**Which should be the first one to find and stop searching?**

We should find the first infrequent subset to stop searching. If \(\{2, 4, 5\}\) is identified as not frequent during the candidate generation, then we can immediately prune \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\) without generating or evaluating further candidates.

To summarize:
- The valid candidate 4-itemsets are \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) and \(\{1, 2, 3, 5\}\).
- The itemset \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\) cannot be frequent because \(\{2, 4, 5\}\) is not a frequent 3-itemset.
- The first infrequent subset should be identified to stop searching further.

### Exercise 7-4: The Monotonicity of Confidence

Theorem 2.1 in the lecture states:

Given:
- itemset \( X \)
- \( Y \subseteq X, Y \neq \emptyset \)

If \(\text{conf}(Y \Rightarrow (X \setminus Y)) < c\), then \(\forall Y' \subseteq Y\):

\[\text{conf}(Y' \Rightarrow (X \setminus Y')) < c\]

### (a) Prove the theorem

**Proof:**

Let's define the confidence of an association rule \(\text{conf}(A \Rightarrow B)\) as:

\[
\text{conf}(A \Rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{support}(A \cup B)}{\text{support}(A)}
\]

Given that \(\text{conf}(Y \Rightarrow (X \setminus Y)) < c\):

\[
\frac{\text{support}(X)}{\text{support}(Y)} < c
\]

This implies:

\[
\text{support}(X) < c \cdot \text{support}(Y)
\]

Now, consider any subset \( Y' \subseteq Y \). The confidence of the rule \( Y' \Rightarrow (X \setminus Y') \) is:

\[
\text{conf}(Y' \Rightarrow (X \setminus Y')) = \frac{\text{support}(X)}{\text{support}(Y')}
\]

Since \( Y' \subseteq Y \), it follows that \( \text{support}(Y) \leq \text{support}(Y') \).

Given \( \text{support}(X) < c \cdot \text{support}(Y) \), we can substitute and get:

\[
\frac{\text{support}(X)}{\text{support}(Y')} \leq \frac{\text{support}(X)}{\text{support}(Y)} < c
\]

Therefore,

\[
\text{conf}(Y' \Rightarrow (X \setminus Y')) < c
\]

This completes the proof.

### (b) Sketch an algorithm (pseudo code) that generates all association rules with support \(\sigma\) or above and a minimum confidence of \(c\), provided the set \(F\) of all frequent itemsets (with respect to \(\sigma\)) with their support, efficiently using the pruning power of the given theorem.

**Algorithm: Generate Association Rules**

```python
def generate_association_rules(F, sigma, c):
    # F is a dictionary of frequent itemsets with their support
    rules = []
    
    for itemset in F:
        if len(itemset) > 1:
            generate_rules_from_itemset(itemset, itemset, F, sigma, c, rules)
    
    return rules

def generate_rules_from_itemset(itemset, current_itemset, F, sigma, c, rules):
    if len(current_itemset) < 2:
        return

    for antecedent in powerset(current_itemset):
        if antecedent and antecedent != current_itemset:
            consequent = current_itemset - antecedent
            conf = F[itemset] / F[antecedent]
            
            if conf >= c:
                rule = (antecedent, consequent, conf)
                rules.append(rule)
                generate_rules_from_itemset(itemset, antecedent, F, sigma, c, rules)

def powerset(s):
    """
    Returns all non-empty subsets of a set s.
    """
    subsets = []
    x = len(s)
    for i in range(1, 1 << x):
        subset = {list(s)[j] for j in range(x) if (i & (1 << j))}
        subsets.append(subset)
    return subsets

# Example usage:
F = {
    frozenset({1, 2, 3}): 0.3,
    frozenset({1, 2, 4}): 0.2,
    frozenset({1, 2, 5}): 0.1,
    frozenset({1, 3, 4}): 0.2,
    frozenset({1, 3, 5}): 0.1,
    frozenset({2, 3, 4}): 0.2,
    frozenset({2, 3, 5}): 0.1,
    frozenset({3, 4, 5}): 0.1
}
sigma = 0.1
c = 0.5
rules = generate_association_rules(F, sigma, c)
for rule in rules:
    print(f"Rule: {rule[0]} => {rule[1]}, confidence: {rule[2]}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **generate_association_rules**: Iterates over all frequent itemsets and generates rules for each itemset larger than 1 item.
- **generate_rules_from_itemset**: Recursively generates rules from a given itemset by considering all subsets as potential antecedents, checking if the confidence meets the threshold, and applying the pruning based on Theorem 2.1.
- **powerset**: Generates all non-empty subsets of a given set, used to create potential antecedents.

This algorithm efficiently generates association rules with the given support and confidence thresholds, utilizing the pruning power of Theorem 2.1 to avoid unnecessary rule generation.

### Exercise 7-5: Support Based on Closed Frequent Itemsets

### (a) Identify the closed frequent itemsets for the support thresholds \( \sigma = 4 \) and \( \sigma = 2 \). What do you observe?

To identify the closed frequent itemsets, we need to look at the itemsets in the lattice that have the specified support thresholds.

- **Closed Frequent Itemsets**: An itemset is considered closed if none of its supersets has the same support.

**For \( \sigma = 4 \):**

Itemsets with support \(\geq 4\):
- \(\{A\} (6)\)
- \(\{B\} (6)\)
- \(\{C\} (6)\)
- \(\{D\} (5)\)
- \(\{E\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, C\} (5)\)
- \(\{A, D\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, E\} (4)\)
- \(\{B, C\} (5)\)
- \(\{A, C, E\} (4)\)

Closed frequent itemsets:
- \(\{A\} (6)\)
- \(\{B\} (6)\)
- \(\{C\} (6)\)
- \(\{D\} (5)\)
- \(\{A, C\} (5)\)
- \(\{A, D\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, E\} (4)\)
- \(\{B, C\} (5)\)
- \(\{A, C, E\} (4)\)

**For \( \sigma = 2 \):**

Itemsets with support \(\geq 2\):
- \(\{A\} (6)\)
- \(\{B\} (6)\)
- \(\{C\} (6)\)
- \(\{D\} (5)\)
- \(\{E\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, B\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, C\} (5)\)
- \(\{A, D\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, E\} (4)\)
- \(\{B, C\} (5)\)
- \(\{B, D\} (2)\)
- \(\{B, E\} (2)\)
- \(\{C, D\} (5)\)
- \(\{C, E\} (4)\)
- \(\{D, E\} (3)\)
- \(\{A, B, C\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, B, D\} (2)\)
- \(\{A, B, E\} (2)\)
- \(\{A, C, D\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, C, E\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, D, E\} (3)\)
- \(\{A, C, E\} (4)\)
- \(\{B, C, D\} (2)\)
- \(\{B, C, E\} (2)\)
- \(\{C, D, E\} (3)\)

Closed frequent itemsets:
- \(\{A\} (6)\)
- \(\{B\} (6)\)
- \(\{C\} (6)\)
- \(\{D\} (5)\)
- \(\{E\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, B\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, C\} (5)\)
- \(\{A, D\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, E\} (4)\)
- \(\{B, C\} (5)\)
- \(\{C, D\} (5)\)
- \(\{C, E\} (4)\)
- \(\{D, E\} (3)\)
- \(\{A, B, C\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, C, D\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, C, E\} (4)\)
- \(\{A, D, E\} (3)\)
- \(\{C, D, E\} (3)\)

### (b) Sketch an algorithm (pseudo code) to find the support for all frequent itemsets, using only the set of closed frequent itemsets as information. Show in the lattice, how the algorithm works.

**Algorithm: Find Support for All Frequent Itemsets Using Closed Frequent Itemsets**

```python
def find_support_using_closed_itemsets(closed_itemsets, sigma):
    # closed_itemsets is a dictionary of closed frequent itemsets with their support
    support_dict = {}

    for closed_itemset, closed_support in closed_itemsets.items():
        for subset in powerset(closed_itemset):
            if subset in support_dict:
                support_dict[subset] = max(support_dict[subset], closed_support)
            else:
                support_dict[subset] = closed_support

    # Filter the frequent itemsets with support >= sigma
    frequent_itemsets = {itemset: support for itemset, support in support_dict.items() if support >= sigma}

    return frequent_itemsets

def powerset(s):
    """
    Returns all non-empty subsets of a set s.
    """
    subsets = []
    x = len(s)
    for i in range(1, 1 << x):
        subset = frozenset({list(s)[j] for j in range(x) if (i & (1 << j))})
        subsets.append(subset)
    return subsets

# Example usage:
closed_itemsets = {
    frozenset({'A'}): 6,
    frozenset({'B'}): 6,
    frozenset({'C'}): 6,
    frozenset({'D'}): 5,
    frozenset({'E'}): 4,
    frozenset({'A', 'C'}): 5,
    frozenset({'A', 'D'}): 4,
    frozenset({'A', 'E'}): 4,
    frozenset({'B', 'C'}): 5,
    frozenset({'A', 'C', 'E'}): 4,
}
sigma = 4
frequent_itemsets = find_support_using_closed_itemsets(closed_itemsets, sigma)
for itemset, support in frequent_itemsets.items():
    print(f"Itemset: {set(itemset)}, Support: {support}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **find_support_using_closed_itemsets**: This function iterates through each closed frequent itemset and its support. For each closed itemset, it generates all non-empty subsets and assigns the maximum support from the closed itemset.

2. **powerset**: Generates all non-empty subsets of a given set, used to find all possible subsets of a closed itemset.

3. **Example usage**: Demonstrates how to use the function with given closed itemsets and a support threshold.

### Showing in the lattice, how the algorithm works:

1. **Input**: Closed itemsets with their supports.
2. **Process**: Generate all subsets for each closed itemset and assign the support of the closed itemset to its subsets if they don't already have a higher support.
3. **Output**: All frequent itemsets with their supports, ensuring no itemset is missed and all have the correct support based on the closed frequent itemsets.

This approach ensures efficient computation of support for all frequent itemsets using the closed frequent itemsets, leveraging their higher-level information to avoid redundant calculations.


![[Screenshot 2024-06-10 at 15.22.05.png]]### Exercise 7-6: Apriori

Given the following transaction database \( D \) over the items \( I = \{A, B, C, D, E, F\} \):

| TransID | Items     |
|---------|-----------|
| 1       | A B E     |
| 2       | B D       |
| 3       | C D F     |
| 4       | A B D     |
| 5       | A C E     |
| 6       | B C E F   |
| 7       | A C E     |
| 8       | A B C E   |
| 9       | A B C D F |
| 10      | B C D E   |

Given the support threshold \( \sigma = 2 \), apply the Apriori algorithm to extract all frequent itemsets.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Generate Candidate 1-itemsets (C1) and Frequent 1-itemsets (F1)**:
   - Calculate the support for each item.

| Item | Support |
|------|---------|
| A    | 6       |
| B    | 7       |
| C    | 6       |
| D    | 6       |
| E    | 7       |
| F    | 3       |

Frequent 1-itemsets \( F1 \) (support \(\geq 2\)):
- \( F1 = \{A, B, C, D, E, F\} \)

2. **Generate Candidate 2-itemsets (C2) and Frequent 2-itemsets (F2)**:
   - Join step: Combine each pair of items from \( F1 \) to form \( C2 \).

| Itemset | Support |
|---------|---------|
| AB      | 4       |
| AC      | 4       |
| AD      | 3       |
| AE      | 5       |
| BC      | 5       |
| BD      | 4       |
| BE      | 5       |
| CD      | 4       |
| CE      | 4       |
| CF      | 3       |
| DE      | 4       |
| DF      | 3       |
| EF      | 3       |

Frequent 2-itemsets \( F2 \) (support \(\geq 2\)):
- \( F2 = \{AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, CF, DE, DF, EF\} \)

3. **Generate Candidate 3-itemsets (C3) and Frequent 3-itemsets (F3)**:
   - Join step: Combine each pair of 2-itemsets from \( F2 \) to form \( C3 \).

| Itemset | Support |
|---------|---------|
| ABC     | 3       |
| ABD     | 3       |
| ABE     | 3       |
| ACD     | 3       |
| ACE     | 4       |
| ADE     | 2       |
| BCD     | 4       |
| BCE     | 3       |

| CDE     | 3       |
| CDF     | 2       |
| DEF     | 2       |

Frequent 3-itemsets \( F3 \) (support \(\geq 2\)):
- \( F3 = \{ABC, ABD, ABE, ACD, ACE, ADE, BCD, BCE, BDE, CDE, CDF, DEF\} \)

4. **Generate Candidate 4-itemsets (C4) and Frequent 4-itemsets (F4)**:
   - Join step: Combine each pair of 3-itemsets from \( F3 \) to form \( C4 \).

| Itemset | Support |
|---------|---------|
| ABCD    | 2       |
| ABCE    | 2       |
| ACDE    | 2       |
| BCDE    | 3       |

Frequent 4-itemsets \( F4 \) (support \(\geq 2\)):
- \( F4 = \{ABCD, ABCE, ACDE, BCDE\} \)

5. **Generate Candidate 5-itemsets (C5) and Frequent 5-itemsets (F5)**:
   - Join step: Combine each pair of 4-itemsets from \( F4 \) to form \( C5 \).

| Itemset | Support |
|---------|---------|
| ABCDE   | 2       |

Frequent 5-itemsets \( F5 \) (support \(\geq 2\)):
- \( F5 = \{ABCDE\} \)

### Final Frequent Itemsets:

1. **Frequent 1-itemsets (F1)**:
   - \( \{A\} (6), \{B\} (7), \{C\} (6), \{D\} (6), \{E\} (7), \{F\} (3) \)

2. **Frequent 2-itemsets (F2)**:
   - \( \{A, B\} (4), \{A, C\} (4), \{A, D\} (3), \{A, E\} (5), \{B, C\} (5), \{B, D\} (4), \{B, E\} (5), \{C, D\} (4), \{C, E\} (4), \{C, F\} (3), \{D, E\} (4), \{D, F\} (3), \{E, F\} (3) \)

3. **Frequent 3-itemsets (F3)**:
   - \( \{A, B, C\} (3), \{A, B, D\} (3), \{A, B, E\} (3), \{A, C, D\} (3), \{A, C, E\} (4), \{A, D, E\} (2), \{B, C, D\} (4), \{B, C, E\} (3), \{B, D, E\} (3), \{C, D, E\} (3), \{C, D, F\} (2), \{D, E, F\} (2) \)

4. **Frequent 4-itemsets (F4)**:
   - \( \{A, B, C, D\} (2), \{A, B, C, E\} (2), \{A, C, D, E\} (2), \{B, C, D, E\} (3) \)

5. **Frequent 5-itemsets (F5)**:
   - \( \{A, B, C, D, E\} (2) \)

This demonstrates the process of using the Apriori algorithm to generate frequent itemsets from the transaction database with the given support threshold. Each step involves generating candidate itemsets, calculating their supports, and pruning those that do not meet the support threshold.
