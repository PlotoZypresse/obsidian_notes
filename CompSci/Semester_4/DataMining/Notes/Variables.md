## Types

### Categorical
#### Nominal 
Qualitative descriptiors that carry no order. For example color(green, blue, yellow, ...) or marital state (single, married, devorced,....) its called binary if it only takes to possible values. for example sex(male or female)

#### Ordinal
Qualitative descriptors whose values follow an order. For example
- Month if the year: January, February, ....., December
- Levels of Pain: No < Mild < moderate < severe

### Numerical

#### Discrete variables
They can only assume an enumerable number of values for example integers.
They often appear as counting variables for example how many children or how many words in a text. A particulare case is the binary numerical variable which only takes 2 values (0,1). ) for false and 1 for true for example

#### Continuous variables
In theory they can take on every value from the set of real numbers. For example temperature, height, Elapsed time 

### Asymmetric variables
A variable is asymetric if only certain values are informative. A numeric asymmetric variable is one for which zeros are not relevant. For example in a data set of words only the words that are present are important

### Symmetric variables
Context dependent, but something like sex is a good example of a symmetric variable
