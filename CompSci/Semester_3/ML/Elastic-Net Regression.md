Elastic Net Regression is like a special tool in statistics that mixes two other tools, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression, to get the best of both worlds. Think of it like a chef combining ingredients from two different recipes to make a new, better dish.

Here's what each part does:

- **[[L2 Ridge Regression]]**: This is like adding a pinch of salt to keep your dish from being too extreme. In statistics, it helps to make sure your analysis isn't thrown off by information that's not that important.
- **[[L1 Lasso Regression]]**: This is like removing ingredients that aren't really adding much to the flavor of your dish. In statistics, it helps by ignoring the less important data.

When you have a lot of ingredients (or data points) that are pretty similar to each other, or if you have more ingredients than you actually need for your dish (like having more types of data than the number of things you're measuring), Elastic Net Regression is the go-to method. It's like finding the perfect balance in your recipe so that everything comes together just right.
