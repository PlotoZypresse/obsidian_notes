# Nodes in a Neural Network

Nodes, also known as neurons, are the fundamental units of a neural network. They are the points where computation occurs, loosely mimicking the neurons in the human brain.

## Overview of Nodes

In a neural network, nodes are arranged in layers: the input layer, one or more hidden layers, and the output layer. Each node in a hidden layer or the output layer performs a series of computations on the inputs it receives from the previous layer.

## Function of a Node

Each node performs two main operations:

1. **Linear Combination**: A node calculates a weighted sum of its inputs.

   - Inputs: $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$
   - Weights: $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$
   - Bias: $b$
   - Weighted sum: $z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \ldots + w_nx_n + b$

2. **Activation Function**: The weighted sum is then passed through an activation function, which determines the output of the node.

   - Common activation functions include Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and Softmax.
   - Output: $a = f(z)$, where $f$ is the activation function.

## Role in the Network

- **Input Nodes**: They receive the input data and pass it to the next layer without any computation.
- **Hidden Nodes**: Perform computations and transformations on the inputs. The complexity of the neural network often depends on the number of hidden layers and nodes within them.
- **Output Nodes**: Produce the final output of the network. For classification tasks, the output layer often uses a Softmax activation function.

## Learning Process

During training, the network adjusts the weights and biases of its nodes based on the error in the output. This process, typically achieved through backpropagation and optimization algorithms like gradient descent, is how the network 'learns'.

## Conclusion

Nodes are the building blocks of neural networks, processing and passing information through the network. The design and function of these nodes determine the behavior and performance of the neural network in solving complex tasks such as classification, regression, and more.
