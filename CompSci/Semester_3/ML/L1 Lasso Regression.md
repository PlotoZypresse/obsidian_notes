#### Overview
- Lasso Regression, which stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of [[Linear Regression]] that uses shrinkage.
- Shrinkage here means that data values are shrunk towards a central point, like the mean.
- The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e., models with fewer parameters).

#### Mathematical Formulation
- Lasso regression adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the cost function of linear regression.
- The cost function is modified as:  $\text{Cost function} = \text{RSS} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j|$
  - RSS: Residual Sum of Squares
  - $(\lambda)$: Tuning parameter (lambda)
  - $(\beta_j)$: Coefficients of the model
  - $(p)$: Number of predictors
- This penalty term causes some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly zero when the tuning parameter \(\lambda\) is sufficiently large. Thus, the lasso can perform variable selection.

#### Key Characteristics
- **Sparsity**: The L1 penalty can lead to zero coefficients - this means that some features are entirely neglected by the model. This is useful for feature selection.
- **Bias-Variance Trade-Off**: By increasing the value of \(\lambda\), bias is increased, but variance is reduced, leading to better model generalization. [[Bias and Variance]]
- **Standardization**: Standardizing the predictor variables is recommended before applying lasso regression.

#### Advantages
- **Feature Selection**: Lasso regression's ability to reduce some coefficients to zero can be used as a form of automatic feature selection.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Lasso can outperform ridge regression in terms of predictive accuracy when a relatively small number of predictors have substantial coefficients.

#### Disadvantages
- **Selection of \(\lambda\)**: The choice of \(\lambda\) is critical and can be challenging. It is usually selected via [[Cross Validation]].
- **Limitation in Model Complexity**: When the number of predictors is greater than the number of observations, lasso will select at most 'n' predictors as non-zero, even if all predictors are relevant (where 'n' is the number of observations).

#### Implementation
- In Python, the `Lasso` class from the `sklearn.linear_model` module can be used.
- Similar to ridge regression, finding the optimal \(\lambda\) is crucial and often accomplished using techniques like cross-validation.

#### Applications
- Lasso regression is particularly useful when you have a high number of predictors because it can help in reducing the complexity of the model by penalizing the number of features.

Lasso regression is widely used in data science and machine learning, especially in scenarios where feature selection is important or when dealing with high-dimensional data. It's a powerful tool when the goal is not only prediction but also interpretation of the model, as it gives insights into which features are most important.
