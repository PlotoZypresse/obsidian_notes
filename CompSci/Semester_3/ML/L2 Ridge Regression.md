#### Overview
- Ridge Regression, also known as L2 regularization, is a technique used for analyzing multiple regression data when multicollinearity is present.
- It adds a degree of bias to the regression estimates, which reduces the standard errors.

#### Mathematical Formulation
- The cost function in Ridge Regression is modified by adding a penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of the coefficients.
- The equation is: $\text{Cost function} = \text{RSS} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2$
  - RSS: Residual Sum of Squares
  - $(\lambda)$: Tuning parameter (lambda)
  - $(\beta_j)$ : Coefficients of the model
  - $(p)$: Number of predictors

#### Key Points
- The primary purpose of the ridge regression is to prevent [[Over and Underfitting|overfitting]].
- The tuning parameter, \(\lambda\), controls the strength of the penalty; \(\lambda = 0\) leads to the least squares regression.
- As \(\lambda\) increases, bias increases but variance decreases.
- It's essential to standardize predictors before applying ridge regression.

#### Advantages
- It reduces model complexity and prevents [[Over and Underfitting|overfitting]] which may result from simple linear regression.
- Ridge regression works well when there is a high degree of [[Multicollinearity]] in the model.

#### Disadvantages
- The selection of a good value for \(\lambda\) is critical, and [[Cross Validation]] or other methods are typically used to determine its value.
- It includes all the predictors in the final model, unlike [[L1 Lasso Regression]] which can exclude some variables.

#### Implementation
- In Python, `Ridge` function from `sklearn.linear_model` can be used.
- It's important to perform hyperparameter tuning for \(\lambda\) using techniques like cross-validation.

#### Applications
- Ridge regression is widely used in the field of machine learning, especially when dealing with data where multicollinearity is an issue.
- It is also used in scenarios where the number of parameters is more than the number of samples.
