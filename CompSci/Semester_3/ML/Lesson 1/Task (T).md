1. **Objective**:
    - The main goal is to predict outputs $y_i$ from inputs $x_i$ as accurately as possible.
2. **Hypothesis Function**:
    - We aim to find a hypothesis function $h: X \rightarrow Y$.
    - This function should approximate the unknown true labeling function $f$, meaning $f(x) \approx h(x)$ for all $x$ in the feature space $X$.
3. **Classification vs. Regression**:
    - **Classification**: If $Y$ is a set of discrete elements (like categories), the task is to assign each input $x_i$ to a class. Example: Identifying the type of object in a picture.
    - **Regression**: If $Y$ is continuous (like real numbers), the task involves predicting a continuous value. Example: Predicting a house's price based on its features.
