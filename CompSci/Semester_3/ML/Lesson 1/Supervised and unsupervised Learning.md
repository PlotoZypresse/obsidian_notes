1. **Supervised Learning**: This type of machine learning involves training algorithms on a labeled dataset, where the correct outcome or target variable is already known. It includes techniques like:
    - **Regression**: Predicting a continuous outcome, such as house prices or temperatures.
    - **Classification**: Categorizing data into predefined classes, like spam vs non-spam emails or diagnosing diseases. Supervised learning is ideal for scenarios where historical data predicts future events.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: In contrast, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The algorithm is not provided with the correct outcome in advance. Key techniques include:
    - **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together, such as customer segmentation in marketing.
    - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifying data without losing critical information, used in image compression or feature selection. Unsupervised learning is often used for exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, and deriving insights from data where the outcomes are not known.
    - it doesn't make predictions it just groups the data
These two can also be combined for certain use cases
