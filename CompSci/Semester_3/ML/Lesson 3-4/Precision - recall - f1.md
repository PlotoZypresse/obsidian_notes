## Precision, Recall, and F1 Score

Precision, Recall, and the F1 Score are crucial metrics in evaluating the performance of classification models, especially in scenarios where the class distribution is imbalanced.

### 1. **Precision**
- Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions. It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions (true positives and false positives).
  $$ \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}} $$

### 2. **Recall (Sensitivity)**
- Recall measures the ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a dataset. It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives (true positives and false negatives).
  $$ \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}} $$

### 3. **F1 Score**
- The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. It provides a balance between Precision and Recall and is particularly useful when the class distribution is uneven.
  $$ F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} $$

### 4. **Importance in Model Evaluation**
- These metrics are particularly important in situations where either false positives or false negatives have significant different costs (e.g., medical diagnosis, spam detection).
- Precision and Recall are often in a trade-off relationship, where improving one may lead to a decrease in the other. The F1 Score can be a more informative measure than accuracy, especially if the distribution of classes is uneven.

Understanding and applying these metrics is crucial in evaluating and refining classification models to ensure they meet the specific requirements of different tasks and datasets.
