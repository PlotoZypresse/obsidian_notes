Confusion Matrices can be used to test different algorithms against each other to see which one is the best.

- True Positiv
	When the Algorithm correctly predicts the right outcome
- False Positive
	When the algorithm predicts positive but the outcome is actually negative
- False Negative
	When the Algorithm predicts Negative but the outcome actually is positve
- True Negative
	When the algorithm predicts negative and the actual outcome also is negative

Using [[Sensitivity and Specificity]] and the confusion matrix we can find out which algorithm is the most accurate
