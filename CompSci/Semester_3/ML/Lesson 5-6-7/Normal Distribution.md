## Normal Distribution

The Normal Distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a fundamental probability distribution in statistics, often used to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known.

### 1. **Definition of Normal Distribution**
- A random variable is said to follow a Normal distribution if its probability density function is given by:
  $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{ -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} } $$
  where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the distribution.

### 2. **Characteristics**
- **Symmetry**: The Normal distribution is symmetric around its mean.
- **Bell Curve**: It has a bell-shaped curve, with the spread determined by its standard deviation $\sigma$.
- **Mean, Median, Mode**: In a Normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal.

### 3. **Standard Normal Distribution**
- A Normal distribution with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ is called the Standard Normal Distribution. It is often represented by the variable $Z$.

### 4. **Importance in Statistics**
- The Normal distribution is widely used because of its simplicity and the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum of many independent random variables tends to be normally distributed.

### 5. **Applications**
- It is used in various fields like finance for stock prices, in social sciences for test scores, and in natural sciences for measurement errors.

### 6. **Examples**
- Heights or IQ scores of a large population often follow a Normal distribution.

The Normal Distribution is a powerful tool in statistical modeling and hypothesis testing, providing a good approximation for a wide range of phenomena.
