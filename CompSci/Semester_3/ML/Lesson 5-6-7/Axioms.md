## Axioms of Probability Theory

The axioms of probability theory, established by Andrey Kolmogorov, are fundamental principles that define the mathematical basis of probability. There are three main axioms:

### 1. **Non-negativity**
- Every event \( A \) in a probability space has a non-negative probability.
  $$ P(A) \geq 0 $$
- **Example**: The probability of rolling a six on a fair die is 1/6, which is non-negative.

### 2. **Unit Measure**
- The probability of the certain event (the entire sample space) is 1.
  $$ P(S) = 1 $$
- **Example**: The probability of rolling any number between 1 and 6 on a fair die is 1, as one of these outcomes is certain.

### 3. **Additivity**
- For any countable sequence of mutually exclusive events $( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots )$, the probability of their union is equal to the sum of their probabilities.
  $$ P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i) $$
- **Example**: In a deck of cards, the probability of drawing an Ace (4/52) and the probability of drawing a King (4/52) are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the probability of drawing either an Ace or a King is 4/52 + 4/52 = 8/52.

These axioms lay the groundwork for modern probability theory, providing a framework for understanding and calculating probabilities in various contexts, from simple games of chance to complex statistical analyses.
