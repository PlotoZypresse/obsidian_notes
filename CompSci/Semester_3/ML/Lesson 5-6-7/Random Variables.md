Random Variables are a cornerstone concept in probability and statistics, representing variables whose values depend on outcomes of a random phenomenon.

### 1. **Definition of a Random Variable**
- A Random Variable (RV) is a function that assigns a real number to each outcome in a sample space of a random experiment.
- There are two main types: Discrete Random Variables (which take on a countable number of distinct values) and Continuous Random Variables (which take on any value in a range of values).

### 2. **Discrete Random Variables**
- These are characterized by a discrete set of values. For example, the number of heads in coin tosses.
- The probability distribution of a discrete RV is given by a probability mass function (PMF).

### 3. **Continuous Random Variables**
- These can take any value in a continuous range. For example, the exact height of students in a class.
- The probability distribution of a continuous RV is described by a probability density function (PDF).

### 4. **Expectation and Variance**
- The Expectation (or Expected Value) of a Random Variable is a measure of its central tendency.
  $$ E(X) = \sum x \cdot P(x) \; \text{[Discrete]} \quad \text{or} \quad E(X) = \int x \cdot f(x) \, dx \; \text{[Continuous]} $$
- The Variance of a Random Variable measures the spread of its values.
  $$ \text{Var}(X) = E[(X - E(X))^2] $$

### 5. **Applications**
- Random Variables are used to model real-world quantities in areas such as engineering, economics, and science.
- They are central to probability theory and are used in defining and studying probability distributions, statistical inferences, and stochastic processes.

Understanding Random Variables and their distributions is fundamental in analyzing and interpreting data affected by randomness.
