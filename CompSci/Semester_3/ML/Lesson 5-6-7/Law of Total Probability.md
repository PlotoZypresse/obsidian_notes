## Law of Total Probability

The Law of Total Probability is a fundamental rule in probability theory that relates marginal probabilities to conditional probabilities.

### 1. **Definition of the Law of Total Probability**
- The law states that the probability of an event can be found by considering all the distinct ways that event can occur.
- For a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events \( B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n \), the probability of an event A is:
  $$ P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A|B_i) \times P(B_i) $$

### 2. **Importance**
- This law is crucial when direct calculation of the probability of an event is difficult. It simplifies the computation by breaking the event into simpler, mutually exclusive events.

### 3. **Applications**
- Commonly used in risk assessment, decision-making processes, and various fields of science and engineering.

### 4. **Example**
- If we want to calculate the probability of drawing a heart from a deck of cards, we can consider the event of drawing each card one by one, summing up the probabilities of drawing a heart on each draw.

The Law of Total Probability is a vital concept for understanding the relationships between different events and for computing probabilities in complex scenarios.
