## Probability Density Functions (PDFs)

Probability Density Functions are crucial concepts in statistics and probability theory, particularly for continuous random variables.

### 1. **Definition of Probability Density Function**
- A PDF describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value. It is denoted as $f(x)$ for a random variable $X$.

### 2. **Characteristics of PDFs**
- The area under the PDF curve between two points corresponds to the probability of the random variable falling within that interval.
- The total area under the PDF curve is always equal to 1, i.e., $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = 1$.
- A PDF itself does not give probabilities but rather probability densities. To obtain probabilities, integration over a range of values is required.

### 3. **Calculation of Probabilities**
- The probability that $X$ takes on a value in an interval $[a, b]$ is calculated as:
  $$ P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx $$

### 4. **Common Probability Density Functions**
- Examples include the Normal distribution, Exponential distribution, and Uniform distribution, each with its own specific PDF formula and characteristics.

### 5. **Applications**
- PDFs are used in various fields for modeling continuous phenomena, such as heights, weights, temperatures, and other measurements that do not take discrete values.

Understanding PDFs is essential for dealing with continuous random variables, assessing probabilities for ranges of values, and applying these concepts in practical statistical and probabilistic analyses.
