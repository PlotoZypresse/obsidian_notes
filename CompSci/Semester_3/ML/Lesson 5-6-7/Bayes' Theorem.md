## Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

### 1. **Formula of Bayes' Theorem**
- Bayes' Theorem is mathematically expressed as:
  $$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} $$
  where \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of A given B, \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of B given A, \( P(A) \) is the probability of A, and \( P(B) \) is the probability of B.

### 2. **Interpretation**
- This theorem allows us to update our beliefs or probabilities upon receiving new information or evidence.

### 3. **Applications**
- Bayes' Theorem is widely used in various fields like statistics, medicine, finance, and machine learning, particularly in Bayesian inference and Bayesian statistics.

### 4. **Example**
- If a disease has a prevalence of 0.1%, and a test for the disease has a false positive rate of 5% and no false negatives, the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease is given by Bayes' Theorem.![[Screenshot 2024-01-14 at 17.30.38.png]]

Bayes' Theorem provides a powerful tool for calculating conditional probabilities and making inferences in situations where direct computation is complex or infeasible.
