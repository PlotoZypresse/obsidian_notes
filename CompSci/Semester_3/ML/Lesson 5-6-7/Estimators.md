## Estimators in Statistics

Estimators are fundamental concepts in statistics, used for inferring the properties of a population from a sample.

### 1. **Definition of an Estimator**
- An estimator is a rule or a formula that instructs how to calculate an estimate of a given quantity based on observed data. It essentially tries to approximate an unknown parameter of a population.

### 2. **Types of Estimators**
- **Point Estimator**: Provides a single-valued estimate of a parameter. For example, using a sample mean to estimate the population mean.
- **Interval Estimator**: Provides a range of values (interval) that likely includes the parameter. For instance, confidence intervals.

### 3. **Properties of Good Estimators**
- **Unbiasedness**: The expected value of the estimator should be equal to the true parameter value.
- **Consistency**: As the sample size increases, the estimator should converge to the true parameter value.
- **Efficiency**: Among all unbiased estimators, an efficient estimator has the smallest variance.

### 4. **Examples**
- Estimating the population mean using the sample mean, or estimating the population variance using the sample variance.

### 5. **Applications**
- Estimators are widely used in fields like economics, epidemiology, and social sciences to make inferences about populations based on sample data.

Understanding estimators is crucial in statistical inference, as it forms the basis for making informed guesses about population parameters from samples.
