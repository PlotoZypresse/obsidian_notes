## Bias in Statistics

Bias is a key concept in statistics, particularly in the context of estimators and statistical inference.

### 1. **Definition of Bias**
- Bias refers to the tendency of an estimator to either overestimate or underestimate a parameter. It is the difference between the expected value of the estimator and the true value of the parameter being estimated.

### 2. **Calculating Bias**
- The bias of an estimator $\hat{\theta}$ for a parameter $\theta$ is given by:
  $$ \text{Bias}(\hat{\theta}) = E[\hat{\theta}] - \theta $$

### 3. **Implications of Bias**
- A biased estimator does not converge to the true parameter value, even as the sample size increases.
- Bias can arise due to various reasons, including flawed data collection, inappropriate method of estimation, or incorrect model assumptions.

### 4. **Unbiased Estimators**
- An estimator is said to be unbiased if its bias is zero for all values of the parameter.
- For example, the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean.

### 5. **Applications**
- Assessing and correcting
