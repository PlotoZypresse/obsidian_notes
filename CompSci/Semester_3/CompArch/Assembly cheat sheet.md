20. **`cmpq -24(%rbp), %rax`**
    
    - Description: Compares the value in `%rax` with the value in the memory location 24 bytes below `%rbp`.
21. **`jne .L4`**
    
    - Description: Jumps to the label `.L4` if the previous comparison was not equal.
22. **`movq -8(%rbp), %rax`**
    
    - Description: Moves the value from the memory location 8 bytes below `%rbp` into `%rax`.
23. **`movq %rbp, %rsp`**
    
    - Description: Moves the base pointer `%rbp` back into the stack pointer `%rsp`, effectively deallocating the local variables.
24. **`popq %rbp`**
    
    - Description: Pops the top value from the stack into the base pointer `%rbp`, restoring the old base pointer value.
25. **`ret`**
    
    - Description: Returns from the function. The return address is popped from the stack, and execution resumes at that address.
	
    **`leaq source, %destination`**
	 Description: Load Effective Address. Computes the address of the source operand (which can be a memory operand with a displacement, base, index, and scale factor) and stores it in the destination register.
1. **`inc %register`**
    
    - Description: Increment. Adds 1 to the specified register.
28. **`dec %register`**

40. **`setne %operand`**
    
    - Description: Set if Not Equal. Sets the byte in the specified operand to 1 if the zero flag is not set (previous comparison resulted in inequality), otherwise sets it to 0.
