To subtract one number(subtrahend) from another number(minuend), take the [[Twos Complement conversion and negation|negation]] of the subtrahend and [[Twos Complement Addition|add]] it to the minuend. Because subtraction is done by addition the overflow rules still apply. The same goes for the carry bit beyond the word![[Screenshot 2024-01-07 at 12.34.00.png]]
