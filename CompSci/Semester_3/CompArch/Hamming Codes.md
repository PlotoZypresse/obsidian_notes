# Hamming Codes

## Overview

Hamming codes are a type of error-correcting code that can detect and correct single-bit errors in data transmission or storage. They are a fundamental concept in computer science and digital communications.

## How Hamming Codes Work

Hamming codes work by adding redundant bits to a data bit sequence. These redundant bits are positioned at specific places in the sequence to ensure that any single-bit error can be detected and corrected.


## 16-Bit Hamming Code Example

### Data Bits

Let's consider a 16-bit data sequence. For simplicity, we'll use `1010101010101010` as our data.

### Redundant Bits Calculation

1. Determine the number of redundant bits required for 16 data bits. This is typically calculated as `r` where `2^r >= data bits + r + 1`.
2. Position the redundant bits at positions that are powers of 2 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).

### Encoding Process

1. Insert redundant bits (initially set to 0) into the 16-bit sequence at the designated positions.
2. Calculate the value of each redundant bit based on parity (even or odd) of specific sets of bits.

### Example

Let's encode our 16-bit data `1010101010101010` with Hamming Code. The process involves inserting redundant bits and calculating their values.

## Error Detection and Correction

1. When a sequence is received, calculate the parity for each redundant bit position.
2. If the parity matches, there is no error. If it does not match, add the positions of the incorrect parity bits to find the error position.

Hamming codes provide an efficient way to ensure data integrity in digital communications and storage.
