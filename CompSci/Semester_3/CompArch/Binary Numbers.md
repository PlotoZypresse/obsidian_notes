## Overview

- **Definition**: Binary numbers are a base-2 numeral system which uses only two symbols: 0 and 1.
- **Key Principle**: Every digit in a binary number is a power of 2, much like how each digit in the decimal system is a power of 10.

## Structure of Binary Numbers

- **Binary Digits (Bits)**: The smallest unit in the binary system. A bit can be either 0 or 1.
- **Positional Value**: Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from 0 on the right.

## Conversion to Decimal

- **Process**: To convert binary to decimal, multiply each bit by 2 raised to its positional value and sum the results.
- **Example**: To convert the binary number `1011` to decimal:
    - Calculate: $1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0$
    - This equals: $8 + 0 + 2 + 1$
    - Therefore, the decimal equivalent is $11$.

## Significance in Computing

- **Foundation**: Binary numbers form the basis of all computing systems. Computers use binary to represent all data and instructions.
- **Efficiency**: The binary system is efficient for computers as it aligns with the digital nature of electronic circuitry, which has two states: on (1) and off (0).
